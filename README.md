# Description

The game is taken from the [final project](https://game-hub-black.vercel.app/) of my team as part of an intensive full time Front-end Bootcamp course.

## Game rules

* The game is played on a grid that's 3 squares by 3 squares.
* You are X, your friend is O. Players take turns putting their marks in empty squares.
* The first player to get 3 of her marks in a row (up, down, across, or diagonally) is the winner.
* When all 9 squares are full, the game is over.
